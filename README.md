FLAMES Game
Welcome to the FLAMES game! This classic game is played to determine the romantic compatibility between two people. The game is based on the acronym "FLAMES," which stands for Friends, Lovers, Affectionate, Marriage, Enemies, and Siblings.

How to Play
Write the names of the two people you want to test for compatibility on a piece of paper.
Cross out all common letters in both names.
Count the remaining letters in both names.
Using the word "FLAMES," cross out letters that match the count of the remaining letters in both names. For example, if there are three remaining letters, cross out the first three letters of "FLAMES."
Continue to cross out letters until only one category is left.
The remaining category is the result of the game!
